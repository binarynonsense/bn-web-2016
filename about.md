<p>My name is Álvaro García and Binary Nonsense is my website and digital playground. I'm an engineer, artist, programmer, game developer... and I use this website as a way to share some of my work and thoughts. Here you can find my portfolio, where I include some art samples, programs, games, designs and anything I think is interesting enough to be shown. Apart from that, the site includes a blog, where I like to write about some topics I'm interested in: books, games, game development...</p>
