          Anyone else feeling those tremors? Are the guys at Site 3 at it again?

          Could someone check if I turned off my computer? I'm out of town and
          don't remember if I did. My office is locked but the password for the
          restricted page to access it remotely is 23HTP5 (my connection here is
          too slow to do it myself).
        </p>
        <p>thanks!! ;)</p>

          Remember that anyone who wants to volunteer to help with the tests on
          Site 3 needs to fill the request form before tomorrow.
